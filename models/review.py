Review Model Module for HBNB Project.

This module defines the Review class which represents guest reviews and feedback
for rental properties in the HBNB (Holberton BnB) application. The Review class
extends BaseModel to inherit common functionality while providing essential
feedback and rating capabilities for the rental platform.

Reviews are critical components of the HBNB ecosystem that:
- Enable guest feedback and property evaluation
- Support reputation and trust systems
- Provide valuable information for future guests
- Help property owners improve their services
- Contribute to search ranking and recommendation algorithms

The Review model creates relationships between guests (Users) and properties
(Places), forming a comprehensive feedback system that enhances the platform's
reliability and user experience.

Classes:
    Review: Model class representing guest reviews in the HBNB system.

Example:
    Creating and managing Review instances:
        >>> from models.review import Review
        >>> from models.place import Place
        >>> from models.user import User
        >>> 
        >>> # Assume place and user exist
        >>> review = Review()
        >>> review.place_id = "place-uuid-here"
        >>> review.user_id = "user-uuid-here"
        >>> review.text = "Amazing stay! The place was clean and well-located."
        >>> review.save()
        >>> print(review)
        [Review] (f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479) {'text': 'Amazing stay!...', ...}

class Review(BaseModel):
    """
    Review model class for the HBNB application.
    
    This class represents guest reviews and feedback for rental properties in
    the HBNB system. Reviews extend BaseModel to inherit common functionality
    like unique ID generation, timestamps, and storage integration while
    providing essential feedback capabilities for the rental platform.
    
    Reviews serve multiple critical functions in the platform ecosystem:
    - Provide authentic guest feedback and experiences
    - Enable property quality assessment and improvement
    - Support trust and reputation systems
    - Inform future guest decisions
    - Contribute to search rankings and recommendations
    - Facilitate communication between guests and hosts
    
    The class establishes relationships with both User (reviewer) and Place
    (reviewed property) entities, creating a comprehensive feedback network
    that enhances platform reliability and user confidence.
    
    Attributes:
        place_id (str): Foreign key reference to the Place being reviewed.
                       Defaults to empty string. Should contain the UUID of a
                       valid Place instance representing the property being reviewed.
        user_id (str): Foreign key reference to the User who wrote this review.
                      Defaults to empty string. Should contain the UUID of a
                      valid User instance representing the guest/reviewer.
        text (str): The actual review content written by the guest.
                   Defaults to empty string. Contains the guest's feedback,
                   experiences, recommendations, and observations about
                   the property and their stay.
    
    Inherited Attributes:
        id (str): Unique identifier inherited from BaseModel.
        created_at (datetime): Creation timestamp inherited from BaseModel.
                              Represents when the review was originally written.
        updated_at (datetime): Last update timestamp inherited from BaseModel.
                              Tracks when the review content was last modified.
    
    Example:
        Creating a comprehensive review:
        >>> from models.review import Review
        >>> from models.place import Place
        >>> from models.user import User
        >>> 
        >>> # Assume dependencies exist
        >>> guest = User()
        >>> guest.email = "guest@example.com"
        >>> guest.first_name = "John"
        >>> guest.last_name = "Doe"
        >>> guest.save()
        >>> 
        >>> place = Place()
        >>> place.name = "Downtown Apartment"
        >>> place.save()
        >>> 
        >>> # Create the review
        >>> review = Review()
        >>> review.place_id = place.id
        >>> review.user_id = guest.id
        >>> review.text = ("Had a wonderful stay at this downtown apartment. "
        ...                "The location was perfect for exploring the city, "
        ...                "and the host was very responsive. The place was "
        ...                "exactly as described and very clean. Would definitely "
        ...                "recommend to other travelers!")
        >>> review.save()
        >>> print(f"Review by {guest.first_name} for {place.name}")
        Review by John for Downtown Apartment
        >>> print(f"Review length: {len(review.text)} characters")
        Review length: 204 characters
        
        Creating multiple reviews for the same place:
        >>> place = Place()

    Note:
        - All string attributes default to empty strings, not None
        - Foreign keys (place_id, user_id) should reference valid existing entities
        - Review text can be any length but should be meaningful and constructive
        - created_at timestamp indicates when the review was originally written
        - updated_at timestamp tracks review modifications
        - Reviews should be associated with actual stays or bookings
    
    Relationships in the HBNB System:
        Place Feedback:
        Place <- Review (this class)
        - review.place_id -> Place.id
        - Establishes which property is being reviewed
        - Enables property-specific feedback collection
        - Supports place-based review aggregation and analysis
        
        User Attribution:
        User <- Review (this class)  
        - review.user_id -> User.id
        - Identifies who wrote the review
        - Enables user-based review history
        - Supports reviewer credibility and reputation systems
        
        Booking Relationship (implied):
        User -> Booking -> Place -> Review (this class)
        - Reviews typically follow actual stays or bookings
        - Provides authenticity and credibility to feedback
        - Enables verified review systems
    
    Business Logic Considerations:
        Review Authenticity:
        - Reviews should come from verified guests who stayed at the property
        - Implement booking verification before allowing reviews
        - Consider time windows for review submission after stays
        - Prevent fake or spam reviews through validation
        
        Content Moderation:
        - Implement content filtering for inappropriate language
        - Review guidelines and community standards enforcement
        - Moderate reviews for accuracy and helpfulness

        - Support recommendation systems based on review patterns
    
    Data Validation Guidelines:
        Required Field Validation:
        - place_id should reference a valid, existing Place instance
        - user_id should reference a valid, existing User instance
        - text should not be empty for meaningful reviews
        - Validate that user has booking history with the place
        
        Content Validation:
        - Text length should be reasonable (not too short or excessively long)
        - Implement profanity filtering and inappropriate content detection
        - Check for spam patterns and duplicate content
        - Validate against community guidelines and standards
        
        Relationship Validation:
        - Ensure user-place relationship exists (through bookings)
        - Prevent multiple reviews from same user for same place (or allow with rules)
        - Validate timing constraints (review submission windows)
        - Check for review farming or manipulation attempts
        
        Business Rule Validation:
        - Reviews should only be submitted after check-out dates
        - Implement cooling-off periods for review editing
        - Restrict review deletion to maintain platform integrity
        - Handle review updates and version tracking

        - Support filtering by review sentiment and rating
        - Enable keyword-based review searches
        - Optimize review-based recommendation queries
        
        User Experience:
        - Cache frequently accessed reviews for popular places
        - Implement pagination for large review sets
        - Optimize review loading for property detail pages
        - Support real-time review updates and notifications
    
    Content Management:

        - Draft -> Published -> (Optional) Updated -> Archived
        - Track review edit history and versions
        - Handle review disputes and resolution processes
        - Implement review flagging and reporting systems
        
        Quality Assurance:
