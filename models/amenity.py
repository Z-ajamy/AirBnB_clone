Amenity Model Module for HBNB Project.

This module defines the Amenity class which represents amenities and features
available at rental properties in the HBNB (Holberton BnB) application. The
Amenity class extends BaseModel to inherit common functionality while providing
a standardized way to catalog and manage property features.

Amenities are essential components of the rental platform that help:
- Describe property features and services
- Enable feature-based search and filtering
- Standardize property descriptions across listings
- Enhance user experience through detailed property information

The Amenity model is designed to work with Place entities through many-to-many
relationships, allowing properties to have multiple amenities and amenities
to be associated with multiple properties.

Classes:
    Amenity: Model class representing an amenity or feature in the HBNB system.

Example:
    Creating and managing Amenity instances:
        >>> from models.amenity import Amenity
        >>> amenity = Amenity()
        >>> amenity.name = "WiFi"
        >>> amenity.save()
        >>> print(amenity)
        [Amenity] (f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479) {'id': 'f47ac10b...', 'name': 'WiFi', ...}

    Amenity model class for the HBNB application.
    
    This class represents an amenity or feature that can be associated with
    rental properties in the HBNB system. Amenities extend BaseModel to inherit
    common functionality like unique ID generation, timestamps, and storage
    integration while providing a standardized catalog of property features.
    
    Amenities serve multiple purposes in the rental platform:
    - Standardize property feature descriptions
    - Enable feature-based search and filtering
    - Provide consistent property information to users
    - Support advanced search capabilities
    - Enhance property listings with detailed information
    
    The class is designed to participate in many-to-many relationships with
    Place entities, allowing flexible association between properties and their
    available features.
    
    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the amenity or feature. Defaults to empty string.
                   This is the primary identifying attribute for the amenity.
                   Examples: "WiFi", "Pool", "Parking", "Kitchen", "Air Conditioning",
                   "Pet Friendly", "Gym", "Balcony", "Fireplace", "Laundry", etc.
    
    Inherited Attributes:
        id (str): Unique identifier inherited from BaseModel.
        created_at (datetime): Creation timestamp inherited from BaseModel.
        updated_at (datetime): Last update timestamp inherited from BaseModel.
    
    Example:
        Creating standard amenities:
        >>> amenities_list = [
        ...     "WiFi", "Pool", "Parking", "Kitchen", "Air Conditioning",
        ...     "Pet Friendly", "Gym", "Balcony", "Fireplace", "Laundry"
        ... ]
        >>> created_amenities = []
        >>> for amenity_name in amenities_list:
        ...     amenity = Amenity()
        ...     amenity.name = amenity_name
        ...     amenity.save()
        ...     created_amenities.append(amenity)
        >>> print(f"Created {len(created_amenities)} amenities")
        Created 10 amenities
        
        Creating from dictionary (useful for deserialization):
        >>> amenity_data = {
        ...     'id': '1234-5678-9012',
        ...     'name': 'Hot Tub',
        ...     'created_at': '2023-01-01T12:00:00.000000',
        ...     'updated_at': '2023-01-01T12:00:00.000000'
        ... }
        >>> amenity = Amenity(**amenity_data)
        >>> print(amenity.name)
        Hot Tub
        >>> print(amenity.id)
        1234-5678-9012
        
        Using with command interpreter:
        (hbnb) create Amenity
        f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479
        (hbnb) update Amenity f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479 name "Swimming Pool"
        (hbnb) show Amenity f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479
        [Amenity] (f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479) {'id': 'f47ac10b...', 'name': 'Swimming Pool', ...}
        (hbnb) all Amenity
        ["[Amenity] (f47ac10b...) {...}", "[Amenity] (6ba7b810...) {...}"]
        
        Using dot notation with command interpreter:
        (hbnb) Amenity.create()
        a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef
        (hbnb) Amenity.all()
        ["[Amenity] (a1b2c3d4...) {...}"]
        (hbnb) Amenity.show("a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef")
        [Amenity] (a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef) {'id': 'a1b2c3d4...', 'name': '', ...}
        (hbnb) Amenity.update("a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef", "name", "Elevator")
        (hbnb) Amenity.count()
        1
        
        Converting to dictionary:
        >>> amenity = Amenity()
        >>> amenity.name = "Dishwasher"
        >>> amenity_dict = amenity.to_dict()
        >>> print(amenity_dict['__class__'])
        'Amenity'
        >>> print(amenity_dict['name'])
        'Dishwasher'
        >>> print('created_at' in amenity_dict)
        True
        >>> print('updated_at' in amenity_dict)
        True
        
        Searching for amenities (conceptual example):
        >>> from models import storage
        >>> all_objects = storage.all()
        >>> wifi_amenity = None
        >>> for obj_key, obj in all_objects.items():
        ...     if obj.__class__.__name__ == 'Amenity' and obj.name == 'WiFi':
        ...         wifi_amenity = obj
        ...         break
        >>> if wifi_amenity:
        ...     print(f"Found WiFi amenity with ID: {wifi_amenity.id}")
    
    Note:
        - The name attribute defaults to an empty string, not None
        - Amenity names should be descriptive and user-friendly
        - Consider using standardized amenity names for consistency
        - The class inherits all BaseModel methods (save, to_dict, __str__, etc.)
        - Instances are automatically registered with the storage system when created
        - Supports both direct instantiation and dictionary-based initialization
        - Amenity names should ideally be unique to avoid duplication
    
    Common Amenity Categories:
        Technology & Connectivity:
        - "WiFi", "Cable TV", "Smart TV", "Sound System"
        
        Kitchen & Dining:

    Usage in Property Management:
        Many-to-Many Relationships:
        - Properties can have multiple amenities
        - Amenities can be associated with multiple properties
        - Enables flexible feature assignment
        - Supports dynamic property descriptions
        
        Search and Filtering:
        - Users can filter properties by available amenities
        - Advanced search combinations (e.g., "WiFi AND Pool AND Parking")
        - Feature-based recommendations
        - Amenity-driven property comparisons
        
        Data Consistency:
        - Standardized amenity names ensure consistent descriptions
        - Centralized amenity management prevents duplication
        - Easy updates to amenity information across all properties
    
    Data Management Best Practices:
        Naming Conventions:
        - Use clear, descriptive names
        - Maintain consistent capitalization
        - Avoid abbreviations when possible
        - Use standard industry terminology
        
        Uniqueness:
        - Prevent duplicate amenity names
        - Implement case-insensitive uniqueness checks
        - Consider alternative names for similar features
        
        Categorization:
        - Group related amenities logically
        - Consider implementing amenity categories
        - Support hierarchical amenity organization
        
        Internationalization:
        - Support multiple language names
        - Consider regional variations in amenity terminology
        - Implement translation capabilities for global use
    
    Performance Considerations:
        - Consider indexing amenity names for fast searches
        - Cache frequently requested amenities
        - Optimize many-to-many relationship queries
        - Implement efficient amenity filtering algorithms
